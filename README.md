Cafe Management System
Overview:
The Cafe Management System is a console-based application designed to streamline the process of ordering food and beverages at a cafe. The program is written in C++ and incorporates various features such as a menu display, order placement, user information collection, and order confirmation. Additionally, the system enhances user engagement by offering two entertaining games: a Scramble Game and a Guess the Teacher Game.
Key features of the system include:
1.	Welcome Message: Greets users with "Welcome to Bam Cafe" at the program's start.
2.	Menu List: Displays a list of items with prices for users to choose from.
3.	Order Placement: Allows users to select items from the menu and calculates the total bill.
4.	User Information: Prompts users to input their name, phone number, and address after placing an order.
5.	Order Confirmation: Displays the ordered items, total price, and estimated delivery time.
6.	Game Options: Engages users with two interactive games for entertainment.
7.	File Handling: Saves order and user information to a file for future reference.
8.	Exception Handling: Ensures the program runs smoothly by handling invalid inputs and file errors.
This project aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly solution for cafe management while showcasing fundamental programming concepts like file handling, exception handling, and user input validation.
